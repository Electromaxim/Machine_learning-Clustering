These scripts are dedicated to solving Clustering problems with Matlab. For Classificationtools please see the adjacent repository. 
<< This is how you can detect patterns and build predictive models from your datasets. Several machine learning techniques are available here to quickly explore your data, evaluate machine learning algorithms, compare the results and apply the best machine learning for your problem.

This includes such machine learning techniques as (unsupervised and supervised):

K-means and other clustering tools
Neural Networks
Decision trees and ensemble learning
NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classification
Linear, logistic and nonlinear regression
